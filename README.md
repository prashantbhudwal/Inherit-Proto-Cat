# dabbleWithJs

In this repository I experiment with javascript and its features.

This is written in the style of an article that I can comeback and read later. Hence a lot of comments that guide me from one line to another. And, very very long function names.

## Typescript

The repo also includes typescript code.

- It is configured to use ES6 modules.
- to start emitting: `npm start`
